These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Contagion</h2>\n<p>Aside from your parasite's basic capabilities and physical manifestations, your parasite carried with it a contagion that you can spread to other creatures. You become a carrier of a unique disease whose save DC is equal to your class DC, and it starts with 3 stages. The first stage's effect is determined by your parasite's origin. You expose a creature to your contagion by either Striking a creature that is already affected by your parasite's persistent damage with an unarmed attack, or you perform the Expose action.</p>\n<p>The saving throw for your contagion by default is Fortitude. Unless otherwise changed by a new symptom or feat, interval times for your contagion stages are 1 round, and your contagion has a maximum duration of 1 minute. However, a key difference for your contagion compared to other diseases is that your additional exposures do cause additional saving throws, but these additional saving throws while afflicted can never improve the target creature's current affliction stage. Failing the initial saving throw against a new exposure increases the stage by 1 (or by 2 if you critically fail) without affecting the maximum duration, like a poison.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<p>At level 1, you may select 2 symptoms for which you meet the prerequisites for&mdash;one each for the second and third stages of your contagion. Some symptoms may have prerequisites, you must meet these prerequisites to select the symptom. Once the symptoms for the stages are selected, they cannot be changed, with the following exception: whenever you level up, you can choose to swap out up to 2 symptoms for any of your stages of your contagion. In addition, you can spend 1 week of downtime to swap out 1 symptom for any of your stages of your contagion. You can only use a symptom whose level is equal to or lower than your level. At level 7, you unlock the ability to add a 4th stage to your disease and select a symptom for that stage. At 11th level, you unlock the ability to add a 5th stage to your contagion, gaining a new symptom for that stage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Symptoms list a stage, you may only select a symptom for a the stage or stages listed (eg. If &ldquo;any&rdquo; is listed, you may place that symptom in any available stage, but if &ldquo;3 or above&rdquo; is listed, it may only be placed in stage 3 or higher of your contagion.

This origin affected the way your body grew accustomed to the parasite, and how the parasite acclimated to its new surroundings. It also gave shape to a physical manifestation to show the signs of its influence on you and determined in part the disease you carry.
