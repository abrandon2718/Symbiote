Some symptoms may have prerequisites based on the origin of your parasite, feats, or both. Once the symptoms for the stages are selected, they cannot be changed, with the following exception: whenever you level up, you can choose to swap out up to 2 symptoms for any of your stages of your contagion. In addition, you can spend 1 week of downtime to swap out 1 symptom for any of your stages of your contagion. You can only use a symptom whose level is equal to or lower than your level. At level 7, you unlock the ability to add a 4th stage to your disease and select a symptom for that stage.

Some symptoms may have prerequisites based on the origin of your parasite, feats, or both. Once the symptoms for the stages are selected, they cannot be changed, with the following exception: whenever you level up, you can choose to swap out up to 2 symptoms for any of your stages of your contagion. In addition, you can spend 1 week of downtime to swap out 1 symptom for any of your stages of your contagion. You can only use a symptom whose level is equal to or lower than your level. At level 7, you unlock the ability to add a 4th stage to your disease and select a symptom for that stage. At 11th level, you unlock the ability to add a 5th stage to your contagion, gaining a new symptom for that stage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; font-size: 10pt;
