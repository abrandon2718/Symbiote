# Symbiote

Hello there! Thank you for taking a look at my class! Here I will go over some quirks and future plans for the class in foundry.

## Persistent Damage
Persistent damage is a key and core part of the class; however, it is not implemented as core in the pf2e system quite yet. I highly recommend checking out the pf2e persistent damage module, it works very well and streamlines the process so you dont have to keep track of too many rolls. Besides that, many of the class features and feats should be automated if they are feasible within foundry (at least for a one man team).
